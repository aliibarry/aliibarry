I have a background in sensory physiology and bioinformatics. I did my DPhil at the University of Oxford with Prof. David Bennett and Prof. Georgios Baskozos, looking at the molecular profiling of murine primary afferents in neuropathic pain. 

Currently, I split my time with the University of Vienna and University of Texas at Dallas using multi-omic methods to understand pain pathophysiology. My work here focuses on human DRG proteomics, as well as a combination of spatial compartmental approaches including spatial proteomics through laser capture microdissection, proximity labelling, and synaptosome profiling. 

I also maintain a connection to the University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neuroscience as an Academic Visitor where I study sensory neurons and iPSC derived nociceptors across paiâ€‹nful conditions and model systems. More details can be found on the departmental [website](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/allison-barry).
